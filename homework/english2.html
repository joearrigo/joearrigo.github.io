				<h1>Physics</h1>
				<h2>I chose to place Physics at the very top of my Chain of Being. Whereas Tillyard opts to place Angels and Ether at the top of his Chain of Being, times have changed and I believe (and science supports this belief) that Physics governs all. </h2>
				<h2>Like Tillyard, I will split my topmost entry into three different subcategories. The first contains the fundamental particles-- quarks, leptons, etc. Everything with mass is made of these. The second subcategory contains elements-- specialized, different configurations of quarks and leptons like Hydrogen or Sulfur. The third subcategory contains interactions (better known as forces) such as the strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational. These do not have mass but they are how we, as humans, interact with the physical world.</h2>
				<h2>The analogy is not perfect by any means (there is a lot of <em>interaction</em> between the three subcategories, but it fits in terms of the "Humans" link on the chain.</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div id="text2" class="textBox">
				<h1>The Universe</h1>
				<h2>Our universe falls very much in line with Tillyard's second link in his chain: The Stars and Fortune. However, one big difference is that there is no real fortune to be found. If anything, it's more of "The Universe and Probability," but I digress.</h2>
				<h2>The universe is the conduit, in a way, between Physics and everything beneath it. It is a tool used by Physics (without conscience, of course). The first stars were largely hydrogen, and as interactions from physics happened, new atoms developed and spread across the (expanding) universe.</h2>
				<h2>Tillyard says that "[the stars] are not autonomous causes but 'open books'", claiming that they are technically understandable, and science has proven that to be true. And, much like Tillyard says, it is still somewhat beyond our wit for us to fully understand them. We still have no clue what dark energy is!</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div id="text3" class="textBox">
				<h1>Life</h1>
				<h2>Life is my parallel to Tillyard's elements. That is to say, later on in the chain, Tillyard claims that humans are made from the elements. Technically that's still true (although my elements are different than his), but humans are more made of life than anything. Life may fall under physics, but it is so complex that we often just call it biology.</h2>
				<h2>Of course, there are also different types of life, just as there are elements (albeit two fewer). Life is built upon cells, which are really just machines that rely on chemistry. Those cells can be one of two types: Prokaryotic or Eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are simpler, usually found within single-celled organisms. Eukaryotic cells are what we are (primarily) made of.</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div id="text4" class="textBox">
				<h1>Humans</h1>
				<h2>Billy Joel sings, "I don't care what you say anymore this is my life, Go ahead with your owl life leave me alone!" That is not true at all. It isn't just his life. It is his life, plus the lives of thousands of other prokaryotes and eukaryotes living within him.</h2>
				<h2>Just like Tillyard's humans, my humans are a mix of the "elements" (life, in this scenario). Between beneficial bacteria, harmful bacteria, parasites (you name it!), humans are filled to the brim with different forms of life.</h2>
				<h2> Greatly enough, this also satisfies Tillyard's criteria for a human to be a mix between all of the other different links in the chain. A jack of all trades, master of none, if you will. Humans are, of course, made up of the elements and interactions from Physics, that were spread throughout the Universe, and brought to humanity in the form of Life. We have electrical impulses coursing through our nerves that make us a machine of sorts (satisfying the connection to the "Technology" link below).</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div id="text5" class="textBox">
				<h1>Technology</h1>
				<h2>Last but not least, there is technology. Technology yields to humans. It is a simple fact. Humans, through their observations of the Universe, created technology.</h2>
				<h2>In a way, as Tillyard says, machines can be "content, unlike man, with the mere necessities of their condition". This may be a fallacy, but machines don't have consciousness, therefore they cannot be <em>not content</em>, so they must be content with their condition.</h2>
				<h2>And, just as Tillyard says, there are certain "kings" to the kingdoms of machinery. A bulldozer does far more work than a shovel ever can. A car is more powerful than a bicycle. A CPU is far more powerful than an abacus.</h2>
